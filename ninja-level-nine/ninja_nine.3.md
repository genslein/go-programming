# Hands-on exercise #3

* Using goroutines, create an incrementer program
	* have a variable to hold the incrementer value
	* launch a bunch of goroutines
		* each goroutine should
			* read the incrementer value
				* store it in a new variable
			* yield the processor with runtime.Gosched()
			* increment the new variable
			* write the value in the new variable back to the incrementer variable
* use waitgroups to wait for all of your goroutines to finish
* the above will create a race condition. 
* Prove that it is a race condition by using the -race flag
* if you need help, here is a [hint](https://play.golang.org/p/FYGoflKQej)
